A program which helps TheHutGroup customer service agents by categorizing and prioritizing customer emails. It has a machine learning based algorithm which is trained on past emails and can categorize new emails in 10 categories, and give them priority. A client fetches new emails for gmail, uses the algorithm to categorize them, and sends the emails tagged with their category back to the email.
