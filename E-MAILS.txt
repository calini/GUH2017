I am writing regarding to my late delivery date. I am very disappointed about this issue since it came 10 days later. I will make my mind twice before making an ordering again through your company.
--------------------------------------------------------
Would you be so kind telling me where is my order at this moment? I really apreciate it. Thank you very much! 
--------------------------------------------------------
I want to know where is my product.
--------------------------------------------------------
I am writing this e-mail in order to ask for a refund, because I am not happy at all with my product.
--------------------------------------------------------
I would like, if possible, to cancel my product delivery. I don't want it anymore.
--------------------------------------------------------
I tried to pay with my bank card, and I found out that my money was taken from the card, but the product wasn't ordered. I need to sort this out fast.
--------------------------------------------------------
Can you give me more information about your products related to make up? Thank you very much for this!
--------------------------------------------------------
Can I somehow subscribe to your company to get all the offers available?
--------------------------------------------------------
I would like to but the My Protein bottle. Can you deliver it to the 14 Langton Road?
--------------------------------------------------------
I would like to get an advice regarding your health products.
--------------------------------------------------------
I ordered a few weeks ago and my order from MyProtein has not arrived yet.
I think the delivery has been missed. Can you please resend it? I also was not in my home
at the date so I mihgt have missed the delivery guy.
--------------------------------------------------------
I placed an order 3 days ago and I am not sure where it is. Can you send me the
tracking number again for my order. This is the third time I am writing you about this.
--------------------------------------------------------
The shirt I received from you was damaged. One of its sleeved was missing.
And it was very small.
--------------------------------------------------------
I want my money back. The product you sent me was totally broken. I will send you my
bank details in the next email.
--------------------------------------------------------
I made an order by mistake. I did not intend to order from MyVitamin. Can I cancel the order before you have shipped it?
--------------------------------------------------------
The website said that my payment was not completed, but my order is marked as 
accepted.
--------------------------------------------------------
I was interested if you give out scoops with your proteins. Because it doesn't way
this on your website.
